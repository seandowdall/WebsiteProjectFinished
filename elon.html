            <h2>Who is Elon Musk?</h2>
            <p id="mainText">
            Elon Musk was born and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. Musk studied economics and physics at the University of Pennsylvania before moving to California to attend Stanford university. It is at this stage in which his life changed as during this time he co-founded software company Zip2 with his brother. The pair sold the startup for over 300 million dollars in 1999 and would be the start of Musk's journey through entrepreneurship.<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk">Click link to find out more...</a>

            <h3>Achievements: </h3>
            <p class="col">
            Musk's startup X.com merged with Confinity and became PayPal. PayPal was later sold to eBay for 1.5 billion, earning Musk 180 million dollars. Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 and by 2006 landed a contract with NASA to transport cargo to the International Space Staion. Musk also assumed the role of CEO of Tesla in 2007, being one of their largest shareholders. This would end up being Musks most successful venture, revolutionising the electric vehicle industry and becoming the most valuable vehicle manufacturer in the world. In 2020 Musk was named the wealthiest man in the world. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk">Click link to find out more...</a>
